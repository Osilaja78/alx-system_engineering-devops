Additional Elements:
1. SSL: for secure transfer of information.
2. Firewall: monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic.
3. Monitoring Client:  to identify and address performance issues or failures.

What are firewalls for?
A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets based on a set of security rules.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
HTTPS uses encryption to protect information as it is being sent between clients and servers.

What monitoring is used for?
Monitoring involves observing and analyzing the performance, health, and behavior of a system or network. It helps identify issues, anomalies, and potential bottlenecks in real-time. Monitoring tools provide insights into the usage patterns, resource utilization, response times, and other metrics.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data?
They collect data from various sources, such as server logs, performance counters, network traffic, and application metrics. The collected data is processed, analyzed, and presented in dashboards or reports.

What to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS?

- Select a Monitoring Tool: Choose a monitoring tool that supports tracking QPS metrics.
- Instrumentation: Integrate the monitoring tool with your web server by adding instrumentation code or using pre-built integrations.
- Configure QPS Monitoring: Set up QPS monitoring using the monitoring tool's features.
- Data Collection: The monitoring tool will collect data about incoming requests and queries. It will track the number of queries made to your web server per second.
- Visualization: Use the monitoring tool's dashboards to visualize the QPS metrics over time. You can see trends, spikes, and variations in the number of queries your server is handling.
- Alerts: Set up alerts to notify you when QPS exceeds a certain threshold, helping you proactively address potential performance issues.
- Analysis: Analyze the data to identify peak usage times, patterns, and potential problems. This information can guide optimizations and scaling decisions.
