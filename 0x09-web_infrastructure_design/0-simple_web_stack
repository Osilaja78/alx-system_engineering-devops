The user's computer sends an HTTP request to the server (8.8.8.8) over the internet using the server's IP address.

Issues wit hthe infrastructure.
The issues with this infrastructure includes single point of failure, downtime during maintenance, and inability to handle high traffic. To address these issues, implementing load balancing, redundancy, and horizontal scaling would be necessary.
