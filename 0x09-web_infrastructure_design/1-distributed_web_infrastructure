Additional Elements and Their Purposes:
1. Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests across multiple application servers to balance the load.

Load Balancer Configuration:

- Configured with Round Robin distribution algorithm.
- Routes requests in a circular manner to each application server.
- Ensures even distribution of traffic.

My load balancer enables an Active-Active setup.

Active-Active vs Active-Passive:

- Active-Active: Both servers handle incoming requests, sharing the load.
- Active-Passive: One server handles traffic while the other remains idle, becoming active only if the first one fails.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works:
- Primary (Master) Database: Handles write requests and replicates data to the Replica.
- Replica (Slave) Database: Handles read requests and replicates data from the Primary.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
- Load balancer and each server could become a SPOF.
- No firewall, potential security vulnerability.
- No HTTPS in the setup, insecure information transfer.
- No monitoring tools, difficult to identify and address performance issues or failures.
